.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sispmctl
is a tool to switch the USB controlled outlets of Gembird Silver Shield PM.
It is known by many names, e.g. Revolt Power Switch.
.P
It is coded in C and does use the usb specific library (LibUSB).
This allows you a portable and fast solution.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -h
Print usage information
.IP -s
Scan all universal serial buses for devices with the ID 04B4:FD11.
.IP -l
stay listening on network port for http protocol.
.IP -p
IP network port (default: 2638) for listener. There is no authentication implemented yet.
.IP -u
give the directory path where pages lay, that are served (default: /usr/local/httpd/sispmctl ).
The Web path component is completely ignored for security reasons.
.IP -b

.IP -o
switch the named outlet to "ON"
.IP -f
switch the named outlet to "OFF"
.IP -g
show the status of the named outlet
.IP -d
Choose not the first but the named one in the sequence of detected devices (see scan option)
.IP -n
do not print "ON" and "OFF", but "1" and "0" instead
.IP -q
do neither print explanations nor disclaimers except it is requested
.IP -v
print version & copyright

.SH WEB INTERFACE

The sispmctl program provides a web interface when started with the
.I -l
option. No additional http server is needed.
Each selected usb device is blocked by sispmctl while running.
.P
After installation, the first of three web-interfaces is selected. The default location of the HTML
files is /usr/local/httpd/sispm_ctl/doc which is a symbolic link to /usr/local/httpd/sispm_ctl/skin1.
.P
The http capabilities of sispmctl are limited.
Technically speaking, only the first line of each http request is parsed.
The terminating path component, i.e. file name, is looked up in the repository directory.
If present the file is parsed and in absence of control sequences sent as is.
The files must include the http header portion.
.P
Control sequences start and end with double dollar `$$'.
They consist of a command portion separated by a question mark `?' from
alternative outputs which are separated by the first colon `:'.
The command portion is a token followed by an embraced number that references the outlet, e.g.
.IB $$command(1)?positive:negative$$
while command is one of
.B status
,
.B toggle
,
.B off
,
.B on .
I strongly recommend to avoid the on/off/toggle commands in pages that may be reloaded.
Best is to redirect to other pages that only include status requests.


.SH EXAMPLES
Switch off the first outlet of the first SiS-PM and the third outlet of the second SiS-PM:
.P
.B sispmctl -f 1 -d 1 -f 3

Print the status of the forth outlet as zero or one:
.P
.B sispmctl -nqg 4

Run sispmctl on the second device as a web-server:
.P
.B sispmctl -d 1 -l

You can connect to it from the same machine by pointing to http://localhost:2638 with
your webbrowser
