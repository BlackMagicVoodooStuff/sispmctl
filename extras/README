sispmapplet.py

(C)2006 Mondrian Nuessle


This is a python script implementing a GUI for sispmctl.
This is just a demonstration what you can do with sispmctl. No Makefile & 
automatic installation is implemented!

To make this work you need the following:

- installed Python
- installed Python bindings of qt AND KDE

Then you need to do the following:

- run
	# pyuic -o $@ $<
	# cat "from kdeui import *" >>$@
  in the current directory

- run
	#chmod +x sispmapplet.py

- you should be able to start the GUI by running
	# ./sispmapplet.py

- Have Fun!
