SiS-PM Control for Linux 2.3
----------------------------
(c) 2005,2006 by Mondrian Nuessle et al.

Overview
--------
This projects adds support for the GEMBIRD SIS-PM device to linux.
Follow the instructions in INSTALL to install the application
(generic configure && make && make install).
Call sispmctl (formerly: sispm_ctl) without commandline parameters, 
it will print the available options to stdout.
Since version 2.3 also 1-outlet mSIS-PM devices are supported.


Installation
------------

See the file INSTALLATION for generic installation instructions.
The following confiure options may be of interest:

--prefix=dif    Set installation directory-prefix (default is /usr/local)

--enable-webless  Disable the builtin webserver. It will not be compiled into
                  the binary. The commandline options for the web-interface will
									not be available.
									
--with-webdir=directory Install the web-interface file to subdirectories of the
	                      given directory. A doc linl in this directory will point
												to skin1. And the path will be default path compiled into
												the binary.
												The default without this option is /usr/local/httpd/sispmctl.
												
--with-bindaddr=ipaddress Give the IP address (in dotted decimal form, i.e. 127.0.0.1) for
	                        the default interface that the webserver accepts connections on.
													The default without this option is to use all available interfaces.
													
--with-default-port=portnumber Give the default port number the webserver is listening on.
                          If you do not specify this option the default is 2638

Dependencies
------------
- libusb 0.18 must be installed, libusb-config in $PATH


Web-Interface
------------
The web interface may be started manually (i.e. sispmctl -l) 
or using the inittab. Add the following line to your /etc/inittab:

pm:2345:respawn:/usr/local/bin/sispmctl -l

There are three kind of skins between you might select:
	src/web1/	classic sispm_http style
	src/web2/	an extended google start page
	src/web3/	a vertical sized frame
The skins are installed under
$(PREFIX)/httpd/sispmctl/skin1..3

The default skin is selected by the symbolic link
$(PREFIX)/httpd/sispmctl/doc which point to skin1 after
installation. You can easily select a different skin by
chaning this symbolic link.

It is quite easy to change one or write a new one. Try it.

The webinterface does not recognize if a mSIS-PM is connected, so always 4 outlets will be displayed.

Usage
-----
See the output of sispmctl when run without parameters and the man page.

Permissions
-----------

Per default, only root is allowed to use devices directly, therefor the SiS-PM 
also only works as root. If you use a Linux distribution that is using the 
ressource manager package (resmgrd), you can add a  line to /etc/resmgr.conf.

The following line is an example for SuSE 10.0. It MAY be different on your system.

add usb:vendor=0x04b4,product=0xfd11 usb

This adds the SiS-PM device to the USB class which can be used by logged in users on SuSE 10.0.
If you are using a mSiS-PM device you need to use the product ID of 0xFD10 or 0xFD12 (dependant
on hardware revision, see output of /sbin/lsusb -v).


Solaris 10 and later come with sufficient libusb support; the ugen (generic USB) driver
needs to be associated with the SIS-PM devices by issueing the following command
before plugging in the device:

    for SIS-PM:
	update_drv -a -i '"usb4b4,fd11"' ugen
    for mSIS-PM:
	update_drv -a -i '"usb4b4,fd10"' ugen
	update_drv -a -i '"usb4b4,fd12"' ugen
